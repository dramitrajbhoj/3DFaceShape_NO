# 3DFaceShape_NO
This MATLAB repository is created to provide age and sex specific 3D face models of participants with normal occlusion developed by Amit Rajbhoj (amitarvind.rajbhoj@kuleuven.be), Harold Matthews, Kaat Doucet, Peter Claes, Giacomo Begnoni, Guy Willems and Maria Cadenas de Llano-Pérula for clinicians and researchers to facilitate diagnosis and treatment planning in disciplines focused on facial alterations. 

The files within this repository can be used with the tool box developed by Harold Matthews (harry.matthews@kuleuven.be) and by modifying the script provided in this repositiory.
